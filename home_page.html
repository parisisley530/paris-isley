    <h1>Paris Isley</h1>

    <p1>Hello! Welcome to my home page. Here I will tell you about me!</p1>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>I am a junior at FAU, I like to build legos and robots and electronics. I'm majoring in Computer Science, minoring in spanish, and am currently working
        as a technician in the Museum of Discovery and Science.
    </p1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p1> I work at the Museum of Discovery and Science, or MODS, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. My title is <em>Lead Exhibits Technician</em>, and I specifically work on the
        computer and electronics. As an exhibits tech, I don't necessarily fabricate electronics, instead I maintain, troubleshoot, and repair the existing exhibits we have.

        Here are some things I've worked on:<br><br>

    </div>
    
    <br>
    
    <p1>A lot of what I do at my job is electrical repair. I work with microprocessors, I solder, I use circuit boards, I replace millions of wires, and most of all, I do a lot of manual resets on the Exhibit PC's.<ul><li>solder</li><li>use circuit boards</li><li>manual resets</li>
        
        
        </ul></p1>

    <h3><span style = "color: blue;"  > Websites I Use</span></h3>
    
    <p1>Going into computer science and already working in the engineering field, I frequently visit LinkedIn to keep myself updated on what my peers are doing and to update my profile. Here's a link to my LinkedIn.

    <br><br>
Another wesbite I use daily is youtube, because sometimes after trying all kinds of different things, you still don't know what's wrong or what to do. Here is a link to a youtube video I've watched a couple times. 
        
<br><br>
        <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3TYBs65FM">How to Solder:</a>
        
        
<br><br>
My company used Microsoft Sharepoint a lot. It's how we communicated within and outside departments, including using apps like outlook, planner, teams, excel, word, powerpoint. Here is a link to Microsoft 365:

    <h3> <span style = "color: blue;" >About Me!</span></h3>
    
    <p1>A little about me is that I like to travel. I'll make a table showing the places I've travelled!</p1> <br> <br>

    <p class = "intro robot">Some personal projects I've done, outside of work and school, are robots. My most recent one is named Toby. Here is an image of him: </p>
    
<div class = "robot">

    <p class = "toby"> Toby is a robot on wheels essentially. He also has a camera that I use an app to connect to my iPad, as you see in the picture. It took me 4 hours to build him, then after building him it took 2 hours to program. To me, 6 hours total is very little time for  a project. If I have the time that day, I would sit at my desk for 12 hours just to finish. This happens most when I build legos. I find it difficult to take breaks when I start projects.

    <p class = "universalp">Another thing I enjoy doing is visiting theme parks! For the past 2 years, I've had an annual pass to Universal Studios Orlando. I love roller coasters! I like the fun in theme parks that you can't have when you go back home. My favorite ride in Universal Island's of Adventure is the Velocicoaster. It's their newest edition, Jurrasic Park themed. It's very fast!</p>
